<h2><a name="herstory">History</a></h2>
<h3><a name="fanding">Founding</a></h3>
<p>The New School for Social Research was founded by a group of university professors and intellectuals in 1919 as a modern, progressive, free school where adult students could "seek an unbiased understanding of the existing order, its genesis, growth and present working."[8] Founders included economist and literary scholar Alvin Johnson, historian Charles A. Beard, economists Thorstein Veblen and James Harvey Robinson, and philosophers Horace M. Kallen and John Dewey. Several founders were former professors at Columbia University.</p>
<p>In October 1917, after Columbia University imposed a loyalty oath to the United States upon the entire faculty and student body, it fired several professors. Charles A. Beard, Professor of Political Science, resigned his professorship at Columbia in protest. His colleague James Harvey Robinson resigned in 1919 to join the faculty at the New School.</p>
<p>
The New School plan was to offer the rigorousness of postgraduate education without degree matriculation or degree prerequisites. It was theoretically open to anyone, as the adult division today called Schools of Public Engagement remains. The first classes at the New School took the form of lectures followed by discussions, for larger groups, or as smaller conferences, for "those equipped for specific research." In the first semester, 100 courses, mostly in economics and politics, were offered by an ad hoc faculty that included Thomas Sewall Adams, Charles A. Beard, Horace M. Kallen, Harold Laski, Wesley Clair Mitchell, Thorstein Veblen, James Harvey Robinson, Graham Wallas, Charles B. Davenport, Elsie Clews Parsons, and Roscoe Pound. John Cage later pioneered the subject of Experimental Composition at the school</p>
<h4><a name="mato">Motto</a></h4>
<p>The New School uses To the Living Spirit as its motto. In 1937, Thomas Mann remarked that a plaque bearing the inscription 'be the Living Spirit' had been torn down by the Nazis from a building at the University of Heidelberg. He suggested that the University in Exile adopt that inscription as its motto, to indicate that the 'living spirit,' mortally threatened in Europe, would have a home in this country. Alvin Johnson adopted that idea, and the motto continues to guide the division in its present-day endeavors</p>
<h4><a name="exile">University in Exile</a></h4>
<p>The Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science was founded in 1933 as the University in Exile, to be a haven for scholars who had been dismissed from teaching positions by the Italian fascists or had to flee Nazi Germany.[6][13] The University in Exile was initially founded by the director of the New School, Alvin Johnson, through the generous financial contributions of Hiram Halle and the Rockefeller Foundation. It was renamed the "New School for Social Research" in 2005. The University in Exile and its subsequent incarnations have been the intellectual heart of the New School. Notable scholars associated with the University in Exile include psychologists Erich Fromm, Max Wertheimer and Aron Gurwitsch, political philosophers Hannah Arendt and Leo Strauss, and philosopher Hans Jonas.</p>
<p>Following the collapse of totalitarian regimes in Europe, the University in Exile was renamed the Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science.</p>
<p>In 2005 the Graduate Faculty was again renamed, this time taking the original name of the university, The New School for Social Research.</p>
<h4><a name="ecoli">école libre des hautes études</a></h4>
<p>The New School played a similar role with the founding of the École Libre des Hautes Études after the Nazi invasion of France. Receiving a charter from de Gaulle's Free French government in exile, the École attracted refugee scholars who taught in French, including philosopher Jacques Maritain, anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss, and linguist Roman Jakobson. The École Libre gradually evolved into one of the leading institutions of research in Paris, the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales, with which the New School maintains close ties.</p>
<h4><a name="drama">Dramatic workshop/School of Drama</a></h4>
<p>Between 1940 and 1949, the New School was host to the "Dramatic Workshop," a theatre workshop and predecessor of School of Drama that was founded by German emigrant theatre director Erwin Piscator. Important acting teachers during this period were Stella Adler and Elia Kazan. Among the famous students of the Dramatic Workshop were Beatrice Arthur, Harry Belafonte, Marlon Brando, Tony Curtis, Ben Gazzara, Michael V. Gazzo, Rod Steiger, Elaine Stritch, Shelley Winters and Tennessee Williams.</p>
<p><center>I attended The New School for Social Research for only a year, but what a year it was. The school and New York itself had become a sanctuary for hundreds of extraordinary European Jews who had fled Germany and other countries before and during World War II, and they were enriching the city's intellectual life with an intensity that has probably never been equaled anywhere during a comparable period of time.

— Marlon Brando, actor</center></p>
<h3><a name="phil">Philosophical tradition</a></h3>
<p>The New School for Social Research continues the Graduate Faculty's tradition of synthesizing leftist American intellectual thought and critical European philosophy. True to its origin and its firm roots within the University in Exile, The New School for Social Research, particularly its Department of Philosophy, is in the minority in the United States in offering students thorough training in the modern continental European philosophical tradition known as "Continental philosophy." Thus, it stresses the teachings of Parmenides, Aristotle, Leibniz, Spinoza, Hume, Kant, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Marx, Nietzsche, Husserl, Heidegger, Arendt, Freud, Benjamin, Wittgenstein, Foucault, Derrida, Deleuze, et al.[16] The thought of the Critical Theory of the Frankfurt School: Max Horkheimer, Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse, Jürgen Habermas, et al. holds an especially strong influence on all divisions of the school. After the death of Hannah Arendt in 1975, the philosophy department revolved around Reiner Schürmann and Ágnes Heller.</p>
<h2><a name="orga">Organization</a></h2>
<p>The New School is divided into autonomous colleges called "divisions". Each one is lead by a dean and has it's own scholarships, standards of admission, and acceptance rates.</p>

<h3><a name="2005">2005 rebranding</a></h3>
<p>In June 2005, the university was rebranded with a new logo and all schools were officially renamed to include "The New School" within their formal names.</p>
<p>Some faculty, students, and alumni expressed concern over the rebranding of the university, and especially the dramatic redesign of the logo from a six-sided shield against a green background to a spray-painted graffiti mark reading simply, in capital letters, "THE NEW SCHOOL" with, in smaller letters beneath, "A UNIVERSITY." They claimed that the university's new identity campaign, while maintaining a slick urban edge, did little to suggest academic rigor or collegiate legacy</p>
<h3><a name="2015">2015 rebranding</a></h3>
<p>In 2015 the New School rebranded using elements designed by Paula Scher of Pentagram using a bespoke font called "Neue"</p>
<p>In addition to the new logo, the school announced that it was combining Mannes, Jazz, and Drama into a College of Performing Arts[21] in fall 2015, relocating most of the performing arts to Arnhold Hall at 55 West 13th St., where the School of Jazz had occupied two floors since 1986.</p>
<h2><a name="aca">Academics</a></h2>
<h3><a name="curry">Curriculum</a></h3>
<p>Unlike most U.S. universities, The New School has a "student-directed curriculum", which does not require its undergraduates to take general education courses. Instead, students are encouraged to explore before focusing on a major, selecting topics that are of interest to them. Although all "New Schoolers" are required to complete rigorous core training—usually of a literary, conservatory, or artistic nature—students are expected to be the primary designer of their own individualized and eclectic education.</p>
<p>The New School's curriculum is highly experimental and avant-garde, offering classes such as: "Heterodox Identities," "Games 101," "NYC: Graphic Gotham," "Punk + Noise," "Masculinity in Asia," "Queer Culture," and "Play and Toil in the Digital Sweatshop."[22] The New School also offers a course titled "Social Media: The Power to Speak the Truth." The course explores the transformative history of the Internet and provides a working knowledge of the tools it offers for journalism and public action.</p>
<p>The university offers 81 degree/diploma programs and majors, with a student-to-faculty ratio of 9:1.[23] This small class size allows The New School to teach most of its classes in the seminar style—especially at Eugene Lang College, which consistently ranks at the top of The Princeton Review's "class discussions encouraged" national listing.</p>
<h3><a name="surch">The New School Institutes and Research Centers</a></h3>
<p>There are several important institutes and research centers and here they are</p>
	<ul>
		<li>International Affairs and Global stuff</li>
		<li>Philosophy and smarts</li>
		<li>The Humanities action committee</li>
		<li>Politics, Policy, Society</li>
		<li>Art, Design, Theory</li>	
		<li>The environment</li>
		<li>Urban and Community Development</li>
		<li>The Center of The Universe</li>
		<li>Scholarships and stuff</li>
	</ul>
<h3><a name="demo">Enrollment Demographics</a></h3>
<p>Thirty Three percent of New School students are international,[25] with 112 foreign countries being represented at the university. U.S. students come from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. 43% of them are people of color, and 5% of American students identify as more than one race. Of the entire student population, 63% receive financial aid, and 17% study abroad before graduating.</p>
<h3><a name="rank">Rankings and lists</a></h3>
<p>U.S. News and World Report ranks The New School as best in the nation for small class sizes and for international student enrollment</p>
<h2><a name="crampus">Campus</a></h2>
<div id="Campus">
	<img src="USquare.jpeg">
	<br>
	Union Square is the place to be where the New School Kids go and congregate and stuff
</div>
<p>The New School's campus is composed of many buildings, most of which are minutes from Union Square.</p>

<p>The university's Parsons division also has affiliations with schools that operate independently but embrace Parsons' philosophy and teaching methodology, including Parsons Paris (France), India School of Design and Innovation (Mumbai, India), Parsons Shanghai (China), La Escuela de Diseño at Altos de Chavón, La Romana, Dominican Republic and Kanazawa International Design Institute, Kanazawa (Japan).</p>
<p>The New School opened the 16-story University Center at 65 5th Avenue in January 2014.[29][30] The tower, which was designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill's Roger Duffy, is the biggest capital project the university has ever undertaken. The building, added classrooms, new residences, and event facilities to the downtown New York City campus.[31] in addition to a library, and lecture hall.[32] While the 65 Fifth Avenue plans were initially controversial among students and Village residents (spurring in 2009 a major student occupation was held at The New School's previous building on that site), plans for the University Center were adjusted in response to community concerns and have since been well received. In a review of the University Center's final design, The New York Times architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff called the building "a celebration of the cosmopolitan city."</p>
<h3>Historical Significance</h3>
<div id="Campus">
	<img src="UniversityCenter.jpeg">
	<br>
	This is a really expensive building that sometimes destroys NYC's water mains underneath the street
</div>
<p>Several of the university buildings are certified by New York City as historical landmarks. Prominent among these is the egg-shaped Tishman Auditorium, considered by many to be the first building to employ modern architecture. It was designed by architect Joseph Urban, along with the entirety of The New School's historic 66 West 12th Street building. Thousands of writer's forums, author visits, political debates, award ceremonies, academic lectures, performances, and public hearings are held for both the academic community and general public throughout the year in Tishman.
</p>
<p>Newer buildings have garnered a multitude of awards. Among these is The Sheila Johnson Design Center, which attracted media attention for its revolutionary design. In 2009, it won the SCUP's Excellence in Architecture Renovation/Adaptive Reuse Award.[33] In addition to being a Parsons core academic building, the Center also serves as a public art gallery.[34] The New School Welcome Center, located on 13th Street and Fifth Avenue, won the American Institute of Architects, New York Chapter's Interiors Merit Award in 2010.[35]</p>
<h3>Residence Halls</h3>
<p>The university operates four residence halls:</p>
<ul>
	<li>13th Street Residence Hall: A facility primarily serving first-year students, 13th Street Residence is popular for its close proximity to academic buildings and location just seconds away from the university's flagship library, Fogelman.</li>
	<li>Loeb Hall: Loeb Hall is a co-ed residence hall located on 12th Street in the East Village. After the relocation of Student Health Services (which was once housed in Loeb), the lobby has been renovated</li>
	<li>Stuyvesant Park Residence: Located in the East Village near Stuyvesant Town. It overlooks Stuyvesant Park and the Manhattan skyline. The residence consists of suite-style rooms and houses mostly first-year students</li>
	<li>Kerrey Hall at the University Center Residence: The New School's newest dormitory, "located on floors 8-16 of [the] new University Center at 5th Avenue and 14th Street, is a LEED-certified state-of-the-art residence that will house 617 [primarily undergraduate] students."</li>
</ul>
<div id="Campus">
